# FutzBizz (Dark FizzBuzz) 

## Overview
FizzBuzz is the stupid game about people try to call the number, but if the number meets some condition, 
They will call it "Fizz" or "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz" instead. 

## Traditional FizzBuzz
- If the number can't divide by 3 or 5 -> Return the number
- If the number can divide by 3 (but not divide by 5) -> Return "Fizz"
- If the number can divide by 5 (but not divide by 3) -> Return "Buzz"
- If the number can divide by both 3 and 5 -> Return "FizzBuzz" 

## Dark FizzBuzz

- If the number can't divide by 5 (but can divide by 3) -> Return "Bizz"
